# Explore Redux with RPN calculator

This is my first project I try to go with Redux though I've been coding with
React a year ðŸ˜…. This is because I think Redux is not very need for my previous
projects. However, in Reddit clone app, I found there is a room that I can try
the technologies, the notification. So this mini repo is my practice for
familiar with Redux before I wrap it into reddit clone app.
